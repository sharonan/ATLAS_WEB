		<div class="Section_A_Text">The mastermind behind the Atlas user 
			experience, Hunter designed Atlas in 
			response to a growing problem he 
			faced while building a successful 
			outside sales organization. A techie
			from an early age, this wasn’t the first
			time Hunter developed a “hi-tech” 
			solution to bridge a “hi-touch” 
			problem. In 1995, Hunter developed 
			an online portal that simplified the 
			process of finding free utilities on the
			internet in a time when free email, 
			free websites, and free search was 
			becoming increasingly popular and 
			scattered. In 1998, he took a small home products company online and increased their sales by 250%. 
			Fascinated by consumer purchasing behavior, Hunter had the opportunity to study Game Theory 
			and Psychology at Yale University. It was at Yale were he developed his love for entrepreneurship, 
			technology, and his passion for making people’s lives easier using both. In 2009, Hunter met Michel 
			and they began plotting out a mobile platform to make it easier for sales people to book appointments 
			with potential clients. The result had consumer appeal. The result was Atlas. Today, you can find 
			Hunter surfing the Apple App Store, snowboarding the Sierra Mountains, or golfing in the sunny 
			blue skies of Southern California.
