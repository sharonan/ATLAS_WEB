	<div class="Section_A_Text">The brainchild behind the Atlas user experience, Hunter designed Atlas in response to a growing problem he faced while building a successful outside sales organziation. A techie from an early age, this wasn't the first time Hunter turned to "hi-tech" to simplify and solve his "hi-touch" problem. In 1995, Hunter developed an online portal that simplified the process of finding free utilities on the internet in a time when free email, free websites, and free search was becoming increasingly popular and scattered. In 1998, he took a small home products company online and increased their sales by 250%. Fascinated by consumer purchasing behavior, Hunter had the opportunity to study Game Theory and Psychology at Yale University. It was at Yale where he developed his love for entrepreneurship, technology, and his passion for making people's lives easier using both. In 2009, Hunter met Michel and they began plotting out a mobile platform to make it easier for sales people to book appointments with potential clients. The result had consumer appeal. The result was Atlas. Today, you can find Hunter surfing the App Store, snowboarding the Sierra Mountains, or golfing in the sunny blue skies of Southern California.</div>
